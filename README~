Welcome to your own Harry potter Adventure!

You are placed in Hogwarts. You will need to seek out the final horcrux and destroy it to defeat Voldemort once and for all.
There are a set of commands in the game. These commands can be used to either interact with the character or seek help.

The commands are:

map: Prints a map of Hogwarts
health: Prints out the current level of health
mov <location>: Moves to a specific location on the map. Prints "Location not found" is location is invalid
pos: Outputs a list of possible locations
obj: Displays the current objective to be achieved and the ones already achieved.
quit: Quit the game at any time.

Health: You start with 25 points of health. As you move from one location to another, you will fight various monsters and lose tour health. With your starting health, it is not possible to achieve the goal. You need to find some health in one of the rooms before embarking on your quest. Once the health is below 1, you will die.

Spells: You can use spells in the game to interact with characters and objects. The following three spells are used in gameplay:
protego: Use it to protect yourself from a curse.
stupefy: Use it to stun a person.
Accio <object> Use it to summon an object.

Actions: You can use actions to influence the storyline when interacting with characters. The two actions are:
run: Run away from a character.
fight: Fight the character.

Objects: You will need to summon two objects in the game: They are
hair: Hairs from Malfoy.
polyjuice: The polyjuice potion.

General Hints: More than one path may lead to the goal, but you will meet different monsters on each path.
               Do not traverse the same path over and over again as you will be unneccessarily fighting more monsters than needed.
               Always reference the map. Plot which places you have visited and what monsters you encountered there.
